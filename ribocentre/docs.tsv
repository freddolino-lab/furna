HDV	4prf	RF00094	100,101,163	2,3,65	The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme is a viral-derived small ribozyme that catalyzes the site-specific self-cleavage reaction. These RNAs fold into a double-nested pseudoknot structure.
Hairpin	1m5o	RF00173,RF04190,RF04191	8,57	8,57	Hairpin ribozymes initially found in plant RNA viruses catalyze the site-specific self-cleavage reaction and consist of four stems in two general domains. The overall secondary structure of this RNA is hairpin-like and named the hairpin ribozyme.
Hatchet	6jq5	RF02678	1,31,62,63,64	1,31,62,63,64	The hatchet ribozyme is a nucleolytic ribozyme.
Pistol	6r47	RF02679	32,33,40,41,42	31,32,39,40,41	The pistol ribozyme is a nucleolytic ribozyme. It was discovered by a bioinformatics strategy as an RNA Associated with Genes Associated with Twister and Hammerhead ribozymes, or RAGATH.
RNaseP	3q1q	RF00009,RF00010,RF00011,RF00030,RF0009,RF00373,RF02357,RF02375	49,50,51,52,321,322,323	49,50,51,52,321,322,323	Ribonuclease (RNase) P is a ribozyme responsible for processing the 5Â¿-leader of precursor transfer RNA (pre-tRNA) and is widely distributed in all three kingdoms of life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya. RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of catalytic RNA and one or more protein components.
Ribosome	1vqn	RF00002,RF02540,RF02541,RF02543,RF02546	2284,2285,2485,2486,2487,2541,2588,2618,2620,2637		2131,2132,2327,2328,2329,2383,2430,2460,2462,2479	Ribosomes are the most critical macromolecules that widely exist in all three kingdoms of life, which catalyze the peptidyl transfer reaction to translate mRNA to proteins. It is the most abundant natural ribozyme with polymerase activity in nature.
VS-ribozyme	4r4v	NA	620,621,638,751	20,21,38,151	The Varkud satellite (VS) ribozyme exists in the Neurospora mitochondria and performs site-specific scission of poly VS RNAs into linear monomers. The VS ribozyme is the largest known self-cleaving ribozyme.
glms	2ho7	RF00234	40	18	The glmS riboswitch is a self-cleavage ribozyme located in the 5' untranslated region of the glmS gene. The GlmS riboswitch can fold into two conformations depending on the presence or absence of glucosamine-6-phosphate. In one of these two conformations, the RNA cleaves itself, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate.
groupI	7ez0	RF00028	261,262,263,264,265,266,306,309,310,311,312	240,241,242,243,244,245,285,288,289,290,291	Group I introns are the first ribozymes discovered in the 1980s. They can use exogenous guanosine as a cofactor to catalyze self-cleavage and exon ligation through sequential ester-transfer reactions. They are found in genes encoding rRNA, mRNA and tRNA in the nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplast in various organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.
groupII	4far	RF00029	358,359,375,376,377	358,359,375,376,377	Group II introns are one of the largest ribozymes, with sequences ranging from 400 to 1000 nt in length. It is also the evolutionary ancestor of the Spliceosome. Group II introns can catalyze RNA self-splicing through an autocatalytic two-step reaction and mediate reverse-splicing. It plays an essential role in the metabolism of organisms and is now being developed as a tool in biotechnology and gene therapy.
hammer	3zd5	RF00008,RF00163,RF02275,RF02276,RF02277,RF03152	20,36	19,35	The hammerhead ribozyme catalyzes the site-specific self-cleavage reaction and is named for the resemblance of early secondary structure diagrams to a hammerhead shark. It serves as a model system for research on the structure and properties of RNA and is used for targeted RNA cleavage experiments, some with proposed therapeutic applications.
twister-sister	5t5a	RF02681	7,9,54,55	7,9,54,55	The twister sister ribozyme (TS) is a nucleolytic ribozyme. It has a possible structural similarity to twister ribozymes. Some striking similarities were noted, but also surprising differences, such as the absence of the two pseudoknot interactions in the twister ribozyme.
twister	4oji	RF03160	7,45		7,43	The twister ribozyme is a nucleolytic ribozyme. The nucleolytic activity of this ribozyme has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro and has one of the fastest catalytic rates of naturally occurring ribozymes with similar functions.
